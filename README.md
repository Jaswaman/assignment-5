# Assignment 5

Chess positions are a problem that have been difficult for computers to solve since their inception. Recently, with the advancements of machine learning, computers no longer have to brute force chess positions to find a solution to a problem. A similar approach was used on the kr vs kp dataset to determine if a chess position results in a win or a loss. Various different well known machine learning algorithms were used with the dataset and the best of which was chosen with it's best hyper parameter setup. The result was a support vector machine with the setup c=1000, gamma=0.01, and kernel=rbf. The result achieved was an accuracy of over 99%.
